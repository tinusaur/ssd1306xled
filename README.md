# SSD1306xLED

SSD1306xLED - Library for the SSD1306 based OLED/PLED displays and ATtiny85 microcontrollers.

SSD1306xLED is a small C library for working with the SSD1306 display driver to control dot-matrix OLED/PLED 128x64 displays. The library is intended to be used with the Tinusaur boards but should work with any other board based on ATtiny85 or a similar microcontroller.
